Koding Kombat is an engaging educational coding platform tailored for adolescents, providing a fun and interactive way to learn coding skills, with a focus on Python. The platform incorporates gamified elements, featuring street-fighter-style beat 'em up combat animations in a unique medieval-themed setting with futuristic elements, including an AI-controlled robot opponent.

## Features

### Quest Mode

Embark on an adventurous coding journey designed for complete beginners. Quest Mode guides users through an interactive story, teaching Python programming basics along the way. Defeat enemies by correctly answering coding challenges, unlocking cool animations upon success.

### Fighting Mode

Challenge yourself in this competitive mode where you combat an AI-controlled opponent in timed challenges. Answer questions correctly to unleash devastating attacks on your opponent, reducing their health points. The winner is the first to reduce their opponent's health to zero by answering more questions correctly.
